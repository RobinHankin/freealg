Given that $R$ is the free associative algebra over some set of
generators over a field $k$, Cohn conjectured (and Bergman proved)
that any pair of commuting elements of $R$ can written in the form
$P(z)$, $Q(z)$ for some $z\in R$.  This is easy to illustrate in the
package.

```{r}
library("freealg")
(z <- as.freealg("2+a-aab+4*z"))
```

We then construct $P=P(z)$ and $Q=Q(z)$:
```{r}
P <- 3+5*z^3
Q <- z - z^4
```

Objects `P` and `Q` are quite complicated, but they commute:

```{r}
.[P,Q]
```
